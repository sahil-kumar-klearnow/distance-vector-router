    Process an incoming DV update from `neighbor_ip` using the
    Bellman-Ford relaxation step.

    Algorithm
    ---------
    For every route advertised by the neighbor:
        new_distance = advertised_distance + 1   (the cost to reach
                       that neighbor is 1 hop)

        • If we have no route to that subnet → install it.
        • If new_distance < current distance  → update (shorter path).
        • If the *same* next_hop advertises a changed metric → adopt it
          (the neighbor's view of the world may have changed).
        • If new_distance >= MAX_DISTANCE      → mark unreachable and
          remove from kernel FIB.

    Convergence tracking
    --------------------
    If any route changes, `stable_cycles` is reset to 0 so the
    convergence detector knows the network is still settling.
